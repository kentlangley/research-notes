# Here is a Presentation/Panel from CogX 2018

## Tokenising Non-Fungible Assets
Chris Burniske, Robert Norton, Charlie Noyes, Jure Zih

"Non-fungible tokens create digital scarcity that can be verified without the need for a centralizing organization to confirm authenticity." 

## Intro Highlights:
- We do not have this figured out
- The "token" is the native asset that is a coordinating force between supply and demand sides in an information network
- Valuation Paths for tokens
- Price can be a multiple of transaction volume (in the underlying network) for Utility tokens (like CivX) - interesting dialog
- You can layer things on top (and not just smart contract driven - KL)

## Panel Highlights:
- Non-Fungible Tokens as a value & activity drivers in the future of crypto
- Sedition - Digital Art Market
- Lots of talk about Crypto Kitties
- Discussion about the community aspect of these tokens
- Digital Collectibles thoughts
- Certificates as ERC-721 tokens
- 721 as a means of provenance verification (trademark office should use this)
- Token Curated Registries as a new economic primitive. Interesting, look it up of you have not
- Interesting conversation about trust in the art market
- Non-technical ways to issue non-fungibles
- The Right to fork / exit
- William Entriken - https://twitter.com/fulldecent (a leading 721 authority)
- Bizarre use cases for NFT
- manager.0xcert.org - Create your own NFT on demand any time you like
